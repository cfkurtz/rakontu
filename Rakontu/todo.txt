Things to do before v0.9 is complete

===== RIGHT NOW:

backup/restore (to SQL) - backup working, restore not so much

grid display color on bottom - not just greyer

LEFT TO DO IN INTERNATIONALIZATION:

deal with _id things not being translated (and in general ALL queries to urls)
move templates to templates/english and deal with calling them up based on language

NEW FROM TESTING:

- more indexes
- no "start page" in menus
- "log out" should leave rakontu, not google account
- admin creates new rakontus
- url query for rakontu

===== PUT OFF until a little later :)

TESTING:

test "send this member a note" thing

FLESHING OUT:

help resources 
export csv details (community options, etc)

SCALING UP:

sharding counters
transactions
custom indexes?
more than 1000 in a query
internationalization
get keys only when possible?
more caching for speed
look at all puts to see if they can be better lumped together

PRETTIFYING:

add cancel button on all pages that save things
javascript sliders for values?
javascript in search creation?
address that ?xx= issue in urls ??
problem with CSS and font sizes...
