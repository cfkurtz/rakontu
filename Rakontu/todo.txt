Things to do before v0.9 is complete

======== BUGS:

in IE menus are grey - CANNOT FIX!!

became liaison, did not get attribut box until next try - timing??

pending member left over after member joined. not being deleted??

invitation email does not have starting URL, just has /visit/home?rakontu=rakontu2


======== ADD:

put "extra" fields in all objects (not indexable? - strings?) for later use

change all url_options arguments to constants for translation

activity level saved in annotation, so why can't do the font sizes in entry, member, charaacter?

add a db.text field to rakontu to use for blurb for invitation email. default is site constant

should be able to choose member type (or check manager box) in pending member list


======== TEST:


FROM PDF:

DONE Use a bigger font on main page for older people with worse eyesight.

DONE What's a Rakontu and What's Rakontu is cute but confusing. It looks like a typo or other problem. Maybe remove horizontal lines and make the text flow?

First page.

DONE Welcome page maybe should restate what a Rakontu is about.

NO Maybe lose the two exclamation points (after email, and after Rakontu)?

DO NOT SEE A blank line above "Helping" in the list of topics?

CHANGED Not clear if "log out" is for Google or for the Rakontu. Might want to follow Google groups for placement of these items?

COULD NOT REPLICATE Clicked on picture. Very slow. (But Google has been slow for me the last couple of days). At least thirty seconds, still no results.

LINKED Remove new page and add to the help page.

===

FIXED When left email address blank to send message:

 A message from Rakontu
Could not send the requested email message. Please check the sender and recipient addresses or ask your site administrator for help.

  Click the Back button to return to the page you were on.

    ... or perhaps you would like to return to the Home page?

        ... or would you like some Help?

====

FIXED I don't understand the thing at the bottom with annotation and nudges. Maybe Change becomes Change View of X
Change Time period

Required role missing

To access this page you must take on this helping role: liaison. To take on a helping role, see your Preferences page.

  Click the Back button to return to the page you were on.

Not sure what I am seeing with Annotations and the numbers? Nudges?

DONE Maybe hint for the heart?

---
DONE Start everything with "show detail"?

DONE Annotation box should not go away if there is nothing that matches. (Object permanance).

===

C: Put tips next to selection options. DON'T NEED?

Put hint over rainbow icon (type of things).

===

If you add a comment and comments view turned off, won't see your comment. Maybe should show it?

===

Only managers can delete their own items if entered as a name... CFK

===

DONE Preferences -- how long unit? Characters?

===

Drafs: "You have no saved drafts. To save a draft, create a story or other entry and click "Save draft" at the bottom of the screen."
What screen? CFK

===

New story.

Algorithm for placemnt of "how do you feel about this story" etc. checkboxes. Maybe a table? not lined up.

Attachments to what?

====

DONE "move choices to top" into preferences.

===

Not enough labels...?

what is the main window? Grid view? Stories in time? Stream view? Timeline?

CFK change help - timeline

===

Put time range permanently at the top. DONE



===

Indenting of "A retelling". CFK

Timeline.

Maybe have control for time periods for Annotations? DONE

===

On filters page, should say what they are. CFK

==

Click on save changes for preferences and goes to some other page. Inconistent. DONE

===

Use case thinking for new member...?

===

Picture reloading somehow in upper corner when it should be cached (memcached and cached in the browser). CFK


---
Does not put picture in a preview. Or other attachments? By name or path? CFK

Added a story (publish) and it vanishes? Why not go back to the story page.
Real problem -- add a story and it is not visible. Should go to the story page.

====

Liason -- shows all people, not just yours... OK?

Should have to pick a person and a character for liason entry.

Clicked on preview:

Error: Server Error
The server encountered an error and could not complete your request.

If the problem persists, please report your problem and mention this error message and the query that caused it.

PICKED ELLIS ELDELRY AND ATTRIBUTED TO CLUELESS NEWBIE
