Things to do before v0.9 is complete

===== RIGHT NOW:

have removed all references to http header "referer" except the one for flags
need way to return to previous page when flagging. may need to make it a form 
and respond in each screen that does it :(


search for use of "yesno" filter in templates - does not work with internationalization
also search for javascript confirm strings, those might not be being pulled out

still some blank answers to text questions causing answers to be kept when they shouldn't

===== PUT OFF until a little later :)

TESTING:

test "send this member a note" thing

FLESHING OUT:

help resources 

SCALING UP:

finish internationalization
transactions
custom indexes?
more than 1000 in a query
get keys only when possible?
more caching for speed
look at all puts to see if they can be better lumped together

PRETTIFYING:

add cancel button on all pages that save things
javascript sliders for values?
javascript in search creation?
problem with CSS and font sizes...
