left to do with limits:
	export - working in general but not for search yet
	general testing of all affected areas - especially searching in member,character, and time range in member,char
	test print and export especially related to search

too many default questions - should be no more than 5 per type

SCALING UP:

transactions

more caching for speed
look at all puts to see if they can be better lumped together
