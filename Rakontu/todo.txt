Things to do before v0.9 is complete

======== BUGS:

in IE menus are grey - CANNOT FIX!!

======== IRRITATING THINGS THAT WILL NOT GO AWAY:

test backup/restore on second testing site.
write instructions for it.

what to do about that keys_only problem? put it in known issues? yes

take age/gender questions out of defaults for characters, and put better char questions in

really need to find some way of moving information from one Rakontu to another,
ie to another site. may need to finally implement that from_xml stuff. what a pain.
google should help more with this.

remove all that no_access stuff, it's redundant 

go through help.csv and resources looking for stuff that's wrong and out of date

======== FLESH OUT:

finish admin manual, developer notes

======== PRETTIFY:

add cancel LINKS on all pages that save things? (links should say where they go to)

problem with CSS and font sizes...
