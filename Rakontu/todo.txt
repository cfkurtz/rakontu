# TO DO

test "send this member a note" thing

guide page:
    also that guides are shown in help (as before)
    guide note goes to all guides

liaison page:
    quick ways to output things for them - this has to be linked to the query system
    
add import/export of question lists (CSV)

check how handling <img src= tag in simple html version (i think am not handling yet)

start thinking about internationalization

UNICODE

need a way for site administrator to DELETE a community (and also disable but not delete)

still have not implemented user choosing which nudge categories to consider in look page

really need that "ALL" button on main page

resource type / get help /  intro page
