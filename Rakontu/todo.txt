Things to do before v0.9 is complete

===== RIGHT NOW:

have removed all references to http header "referer" except the one for flags
need way to return to previous page when flagging. may need to make it a form 
and respond in each screen that does it :(

do that thing about the pytz info files being zipped - too many files!

===== PUT OFF until a little later :)

TESTING:

test "send this member a note" thing

FLESHING OUT:

help resources 

SCALING UP:

transactions
custom indexes?
more than 1000 in a query
finish internationalization
get keys only when possible?
more caching for speed
look at all puts to see if they can be better lumped together

PRETTIFYING:

add cancel button on all pages that save things
javascript sliders for values?
javascript in search creation?
problem with CSS and font sizes...
