Things to do before v0.9 is complete

======== BUGS:

in IE menus are grey - CANNOT FIX!!

======== ADD:

put "extra" fields in all objects (not indexable? - strings?) for later use

change all url_options arguments to constants for translation

activity level saved in annotation, so why can't do the font sizes in entry, member, charaacter?

======== CHECK:

Use a bigger font on main page for older people with worse eyesight.

Put tips next to selection options. DON'T NEED?

If you add a comment and comments view turned off, won't see your comment. Maybe should show it?

Only managers can delete their own items if entered as a name... CFK

Drafts: "You have no saved drafts. To save a draft, create a story or other entry and click "Save draft" at the bottom of the screen."
What screen? CFK

Algorithm for placemnt of "how do you feel about this story" etc. checkboxes. Maybe a table? not lined up.

entry.html - Attachments to what?

CFK change help - timeline

Indenting of "A retelling". CFK

On my stuff - filters page, should say what they are. CFK

Picture reloading somehow in upper corner when it should be cached (memcached and cached in the browser). CFK

Does not put picture in a preview. Or other attachments? By name or path? CFK

Liason enters story -- shows all people, not just yours... OK? (yes but explain better)

"Revert to" instead of "recall" on story text versions

For things that you can't do, provide help or link (ex. batch entry)

check front page for keeping new members; check not in twice?

Still not bigger font on pdf pc. 


======== FLESH OUT:

finish admin manual, developer notes

web site

white papers

architecture document

======== PRETTIFY:

add cancel LINKS on all pages that save things? (links should say where they go to)

problem with CSS and font sizes...
