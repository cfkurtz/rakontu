Things to do before v0.1 is complete

# BUGS RIGHT NOW


# TO DO

test "send this member a note" thing

guide page:
    also that guides are shown in help (as before)
    guide note goes to all guides

liaison page:
    quick ways to output things for them - this has to be linked to the query system
    
add import/export of question lists (CSV)

start thinking about internationalization

need a way for site administrator to DELETE a community (and also disable but not delete)
no, an OWNER can delete a community. but they need a way to do it.

still have not implemented user choosing which nudge categories to consider in look page

really need that "ALL" button on main page

tag cloud view? in look page?

backup/restore (gaeutilities)?

change manage questions menu - submenu or start page - messy looking

sharding counters? what happens if more than 1000 in a query?

add option for resources that they can be seen by only people in some roles
this is a way to add help resources for say curators only or for managers only. ?? or not ??

new member CONFIRM membership on that page. also enter nickname and whether it is real name.

not reporting whether nickname is real name. keep or get rid of?

add guide screen with all requests by type

need a way for a member to QUIT the community. on their profile page? confirm page needed.

need way to reference attachment in entry text and show inline

should have page where admin can choose which system help resources to include ?
