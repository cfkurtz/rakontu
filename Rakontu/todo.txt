Things to do before v0.1 is complete

# BUGS RIGHT NOW


# TO DO

test "send this member a note" thing

liaison page:
    quick ways to output things for them - this has to be linked to the query system
    
add import/export of question lists (CSV)

start thinking about internationalization

need a way for site administrator to DELETE a community (and also disable but not delete)
no, an OWNER can delete a community. but they need a way to do it.
	- have inactivation working, but need a screen for sys admin to reactivate OR remove all data for a community
	- NEED TO FINISH THIS

still have not implemented user choosing which nudge categories to consider in look page

really need that "ALL" button on main page

tag cloud view? in look page?

backup/restore (gaeutilities)?

sharding counters? what happens if more than 1000 in a query?

add option for resources that they can be seen by only people in some roles
this is a way to add help resources for say curators only or for managers only. ?? or not ??

should have page where admin can choose which system help resources to include ?

ask member what text format they want to come up by default for entries and annotations (not for community things)

check "keepAnswer" - seems like answers are being kept when None

address that ?xx= issue in urls ??
