Things to do before v0.9 is complete

======== BUGS:

in IE menus are grey - CANNOT FIX!!

======== ADD:

put "extra" fields in all objects (not indexable? - strings?) for later use

change all url_options arguments to constants for translation

======== CHECK:


Put tips next to selection options. DON'T NEED?

If you add a comment and comments view turned off, won't see your comment. Maybe should show it?

Only managers can delete their own items if entered as a name... CFK

Drafts: "You have no saved drafts. To save a draft, create a story or other entry and click "Save draft" at the bottom of the screen."
What screen? CFK

On my stuff - filters page, should say what they are. CFK

Picture reloading somehow in upper corner when it should be cached (memcached and cached in the browser). CFK

Does not put picture in a preview. Or other attachments? By name or path? CFK

Liason enters story -- shows all people, not just yours... OK? (yes but explain better)

For things that you can't do, provide help or link (ex. batch entry)

I haven't really thought very much about what happens when people accidentally leave things blank
in forms. Should some things be required?


======== FLESH OUT:

finish admin manual, developer notes

web site

white papers

architecture document

======== PRETTIFY:

add cancel LINKS on all pages that save things? (links should say where they go to)

problem with CSS and font sizes...
