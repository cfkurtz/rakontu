	general testing of all affected areas - especially searching in member,character, and time range in member,char
	test print and export especially related to search
	
revisit that pytz zip thing !

move "send member a message" to another screeen? - put checkmarks in member screen? send to multiple members at once?
whether they want to use their email in messages as reply to, or use alternative email

test menus in IE6 in parallels

put caution thing next to all uploads warning about timeouts if large files are uploaded

i wish the rakontu image wouldn't light up when you hover over it - why does it do that???

test approcket on server!

too many default questions - should be no more than 5 per type

memcache and entries for rakontu

SCALING UP:

transactions
more than 1000 in a query - WORKING ON 
long-running processes

custom indexes?
get keys only when possible?
more caching for speed
look at all puts to see if they can be better lumped together

PRETTIFYING:

add cancel button on all pages that save things?
javascript sliders for values?
javascript in search creation?
problem with CSS and font sizes...
