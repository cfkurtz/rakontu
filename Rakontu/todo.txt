Things to do before v0.9 is complete

TESTING:

CHANGES TO DB:
should there be a way to set the order of questions ? they come out in random order.
yes, and make a per-question edit page ? table is too unweildy, and I hate limiting the number of choices
to a fixed number. should be open textarea with carriage returns between choices.

list has 
	[active] [move up] [move down] Text? (name - type)
	
click text to edit on its own page (and preview on page?? why not?)

should resources have an order within their category? also random.

add member option of how long texts should be. i can imagine changing that at different times.

what about having some questions marked as "teller only" questions ?? would that be too hard to implement?

put "extra" fields in all objects (not indexable? - strings?) for later use

NOT DB CHANGES:
would like guide-resources page to be able to select type of resource (help, new members, managers, all, category)

emotion question (how feel) needs to have different answers for story, invitation whatever ??


BUGS RIGHT NOW:


FLESHING OUT:

finish help resources 

test approcket on server!

PRETTIFYING:

add cancel LINKS on all pages that save things? (links should say where they go to)
problem with CSS and font sizes...

javascript sliders for values?
javascript in search creation?
