Things to do before v0.9 is complete

TESTING:

test "send this member a note" thing

curate from main page - add "curate" button
move curate option to button on other things
feels like it should be a button

move reported nudge points for member to their own profile page, out of member page
get rid of "last x" on member page

on read page, move "change your xx" to link that is less obvious? don't like having it in drop-down box

BUGS RIGHT NOW:


FLESHING OUT:

finish help resources 

test approcket on server!

PRETTIFYING:

add cancel LINKS on all pages that save things? (links should say where they go to)
problem with CSS and font sizes...

javascript sliders for values?
javascript in search creation?
