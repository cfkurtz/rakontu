Things to do before v0.1 is complete

# BUGS RIGHT NOW


# TO DO

- need to add "send this member a note" thing
in member page
- DID THIS but haven't tested it yet

- guide note goes to all guides?
or choose one?

- mgrs/owners can get emails
sent to them when new inappropriate flags are set
by curators
(what other times?)

-curator page:
	data centric - see how data is shaped and linked   
    deep freeze view
    entry web?
    attachments list (to review for noxious stuff)
    faster/easier way to add relate links?
    faster/easier way to build observations?

guide page:
	people centric - what people are doing
    invitations with no responses
    stories with no annotations
    resources
    not full member histories, but
        some shorter kind of summary
        of member activity
        # stories, comments, etc
    also that guides are shown in help (as before)

how add offline members?
maybe only liaisons can add offline members?
maybe managers/owners cannot?
would that be a problem?
it's not like the offline members can get on the
system and DO anything
and if a liaison does rude things with fake offline members
the mgrs can just ban them from being a liaison

liaison page:
    your offline members
    their histories
    add offline member / remove
    quick ways to output things for them
    stories, comments about their stories, etc
    
add import/export of question lists (CSV)
	
with markup - allow to refer to image in attachments {1} {2} etc
also check how handling <img src= tag in simple html version (i think am not handling yet)

start thinking about internationalization

UNICODE

need a way to nudge things from the main page - you just want to do it - icon?

in the community settings it says you can set it so members have to check a box
before becoming a curator etc, but you really don't

need a way for site administrator to DELETE a community (and also disable but not delete)

need better feedback when a person has done a thing - action completed page? that tells you what you just did?

check all input texts to set maxlength to fit into string property

don't show manager/owner status to group, just that they are a manager. owner status should not be obvious to all members.
