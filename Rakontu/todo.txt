Things to do before v0.1 is complete

# BUGS RIGHT NOW


# TO DO

- need to add "send this member a note" thing
in member page
- DID THIS but haven't tested it yet

- guide note goes to all guides?
or choose one?

guide page:
    also that guides are shown in help (as before)

liaison page:
    quick ways to output things for them - this has to be linked to the query system
    
add import/export of question lists (CSV)

is that "your changes have been saved" page really necessary?
	
with markup - allow to refer to image in attachments {1} {2} etc
also check how handling <img src= tag in simple html version (i think am not handling yet)

start thinking about internationalization

UNICODE

I don't think downdrift is working yet

need a way to nudge things from the main page - you just want to do it - icon?

need a way for site administrator to DELETE a community (and also disable but not delete)

check all input texts to set maxlength to fit into string property

cannot allow two members in the same community to have the same nickname, because
offline members are identified by it. not checking for that when somebody sets one.

still have not implemented user choosing which nudge categories to consider in look page

don't show manager/owner status to group, just that they are a manager. owner status should not be obvious to all members.

resource type / get help /  intro page

number of tags, number of nudges not FULLY updated for flexibility yet - check EVERY use

questions not deleted

attribution in batch

date collected in not batch, if liaison
