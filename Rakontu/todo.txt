Things to do before v0.1 is complete

RIGHT NOW:

QUERY

PIVOT

liaison page:
    quick ways to output things for them - this has to be linked to the query system
    
add import/export of question lists (CSV)

still have not implemented user choosing which nudge categories to consider in look page

ask member what text format they want to come up by default for entries and annotations (not for community things)

check "keepAnswer" - seems like answers are being kept when None

PUT OFF until a little later :)

test "send this member a note" thing
address that ?xx= issue in urls ??
backup/restore (gaeutilities)?
sharding counters? 
what happens if more than 1000 in a query?
start thinking about internationalization
really need that "ALL" button on main page
tag cloud view? in look page?
