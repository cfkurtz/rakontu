Things to do before v0.9 is complete

TESTING:

should there be a way to set the order of questions ? they come out in random order.
should resources have an order within their category? also random.

what about having some questions marked as "teller only" questions ?? would that be too hard to implement?

would like guide-resources page to be able to select type of resource (help, new members, managers, all, category)

emotion question (how feel) needs to have different answers for story, invitation whatever ??

add member option of how long texts should be. i can imagine changing that at different times.

BUGS RIGHT NOW:


FLESHING OUT:

finish help resources 

test approcket on server!

PRETTIFYING:

add cancel LINKS on all pages that save things? (links should say where they go to)
problem with CSS and font sizes...

javascript sliders for values?
javascript in search creation?
