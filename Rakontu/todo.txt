Things to do before v0.1 is complete

# BUGS RIGHT NOW


# TO DO

test "send this member a note" thing

guide page:
    also that guides are shown in help (as before)
    guide note goes to all guides

liaison page:
    quick ways to output things for them - this has to be linked to the query system
    
add import/export of question lists (CSV)

check how handling <img src= tag in simple html version (i think am not handling yet)

start thinking about internationalization

need a way for site administrator to DELETE a community (and also disable but not delete)

still have not implemented user choosing which nudge categories to consider in look page

really need that "ALL" button on main page

tag cloud view? in look page?

backup/restore (gaeutilities)?

change manage questions menu - submenu or start page - messy looking

consider indexing of some fields for speed

sharding counters? what happens if more than 1000 in a query?

some "canned" system resources - a quick intro help file

change help.csv so that it never uses non-# items (too confusing)

add option for resources that they can be seen by only people in some roles
this is a way to add help resources for say curators only or for managers only.
