Things to do before v0.9 is complete

===== RIGHT NOW:

TESTING:

test "send this member a note" thing

FLESHING OUT:

help resources 

must do a "check availability" on nickname thing
cannot be on that page

SCALING UP:

transactions
more than 1000 in a query
long-running processes

custom indexes?
get keys only when possible?
more caching for speed
look at all puts to see if they can be better lumped together

PRETTIFYING:

add cancel button on all pages that save things?
javascript sliders for values?
javascript in search creation?
problem with CSS and font sizes...
