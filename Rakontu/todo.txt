Things to do before v0.1 is complete

# BUGS RIGHT NOW

- if you enter a story with answers, it doesn't show your answers in the read page. it asks you
if you want to enter more. are there answers? may be lost due to recent changes with save/publish system.

# TO DO

- resources should also be able to create remind links to stories

- need to add "send this member a note" thing
in member page
- DID THIS but haven't tested it yet

- guide note goes to all guides?
or choose one?

- mgrs/owners can get emails
sent to them when new inappropriate flags are set
by curators
(what other times?)

- mgrs/owners need deep freeze view page (was basement)
where you can see and delete articles
- NEED DEEP FREEZE? maybe it's just in the viewing prefs?

- does the article nudge value start at zero?

-character items only anonymous in display
mgrs/owners cannot see who wrote them
but site admins can (by querying database,
info is in there, in creator field)

-curator page:
	data centric - see how data is shaped and linked   
    deep freeze view
    entry web?
    attachments list (to review for noxious stuff)
    faster/easier way to add relate links?
    faster/easier way to build observations?

guides can enter resources
guide page:
	people centric - what people are doing
    invitations with no responses
    stories with no annotations
    resources
    not full member histories, but
        some shorter kind of summary
        of member activity
        # stories, comments, etc
    also that guides are shown in help (as before)

how add offline members?
maybe only liaisons can add offline members?
maybe managers/owners cannot?
would that be a problem?
it's not like the offline members can get on the
system and DO anything
and if a liaison does rude things with fake offline members
the mgrs can just ban them from being a liaison

liaison page:
    your offline members
    their histories
    add offline member / remove
    quick ways to output things for them
    stories, comments about their stories, etc
    
finish relate, include links

instead of system questions being always generated, make button to do that in each question page
that way no clutter if they don't want them
add import/export of question lists (CSV)
	
that whole thing about escaping texts while allowing some simple html to pass through
can do - s/r then escape then s/r again
