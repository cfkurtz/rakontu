"Little Bird","Have you ever heard someone say that a little bird told them something? Well, I'm that little bird! I hear about everything that goes on around here, and I like to tell about it.","Little Bird is a good character to use when you want to tell about something that happened but you don't want to offend anyone by saying exactly who was involved. When you use Little Bird, don't name names, just say ""a person I know"" or ""somebody who lives near here"" and so on.","littlebird.png"
"Old Coot","I'm not a very friendly person, but I know a lot, if anybody would ever listen to me. Bunch of newcomers! Hmph.","Old Coot is a great character to take on when you want to complain about something, even if you aren't old yourself. However, it's not for attacking people, which is bad netiquette in any personality. However, being grouchy in general is fine!","oldcoot.png"
"Clueless newbie","Hi! What's this about? What am I supposed to do? Who is everybody here? Does anybody know how to fix my problem? What manual?","Clueless Newbie is for where you have a question or comment or story that might make you look like you don't know much. The main rule for being Clueless Newbie is to refrain from demanding help!","newbie.png"
