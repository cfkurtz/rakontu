Rakontu is a web application that helps groups, communities, and families share and work with stories. 

=== What it's for

Rakontu is for small groups of people (usually fewer than 50) who have something they would like to share 
experiences about: something they do together, a place they live in, a history they share. A Rakontu is 
both a living history museum and a gathering place to share what's going on. 

=== What you can do

These are the things you can do in a Rakontu:

  * You can tell stories, and people can comment on them, answer questions about them, describe them with 
    tags, ask questions about them, and rate them on issues important to the Rakontu. 
  * You can ask other people to tell stories about things you want to hear about.
  * You can look for stories in many different ways. If you see an interesting pattern, you can save it and ask 
    other people to comment on it.
  * You can build story collages, which are assemblages of stories you want to remember or present for a reason.

=== Doing more

If you like, you can take on a *helping role* in your Rakontu.

  * *Curators* watch over the living museum of stories, making sure they are clean and well connected.
  * *Guides* help other people use the system and encourage people to participate in the Rakontu.
  * *Liaisons* provide bridges between on-line members of the Rakontu (people who use the web site) 
    and off-line members (people who tell and hear stories but don't use the web site).

[People in Rakontu]
Category=Introduction
Order in category=2
Interpret as=Wiki markup
Managers only=no
== Members

Everyone who has access to a Rakontu site is a *member* of the Rakontu. All members can tell stories, ask other people 
to tell stories, build collages and note patterns. All members can tag, comment on, add a request to, and nudge stories and other entries.

=== Managers

Some of the people in the Rakontu are managers. These are the people who can change all of the governance-type 
settings in the Rakontu, such as what questions are asked about entries and members. Managers must be made managers 
by other managers. Members must be made members by Rakontu managers or site administrators.

=== Owners

At least one manager is called an owner. The only additional thing an owner can do is delete the Rakontu 
(so this person has to be trustworthy!). Usually the owner will be the person who started the Rakontu.

=== Helpers

There are three "helping roles" in any Rakontu. These are always volunteer roles, and any member can take them 
on simply by checking a box that says they want to do this. (However, managers can ban a member from doing this if 
they need to, for example if someone abuses the privileges of the role.)

  * *Curators* are the herders of the stories and other information. They have the right to roam over the web site flagging 
  inappropriate items for deletion. They have summary screens they can use to review missing links and other gaps 
  in the data set.

  * *Guides* are the people-helpers of the system. They alone can create resources, and they can review requests attached
  to entries, such as those needing transcription. When people need help, they can ask a guide.

  * *Liaisons* are bridges between on-line and off-line members of a Rakontu. Off-line members can tell stories,
  read and hear stories, and make comments and other annotations. Liaisons enter all of this information for them
  and output things for them to read and hear. 

=== Characters

Sometimes it's hard to tell a story that needs to be told. Rakontus can optionally set up characters, which are 
sort of like masks people can put on to tell a story they would rather not have labeled as their own. Information about who 
told the story is still in the system, but nobody in the Rakontu (including its managers) can see it. Only a site 
administrator can see identifying information, and only with some effort. Characters have answers to questions as well, 
so you can search on things like "Show me stories told by characters that describe themselves as 'strong' where the 
storyteller said the story made them feel 'weak'."

Rakontus may vary on whether they have characters and which types of entries and annotations are allowed to use 
character attribution.

There are three main types of object in Rakontu: entries, annotations and answers.

== Entries

Entries are the most important items in Rakontu. They are sort of like Wikipedia articles in that everything "hangs off" them. 
Most entries will be stories; but there are also four other kinds of entry.

  * *Invitations* are story solicitations. They propose topics for people to tell stories about.

  * *Collages* are groupings of stories. People may have many reasons to group stories together and highlight them. 
  In Rakontu 1.0 collages are just simple annotated lists of stories. Future versions are envisioned in which collages 
  can be time lines, composite stories, and other more complex groupings.

  * *Patterns* are observations about stories that have been told, usually together with answers to questions about them. 
  Patterns might be things like "I noticed that people over 60 were more likely to tell stories about hats, while people under 
  30 were more likely to tell stories about cats." While a collage is essentially an annotated list of stories, a pattern is 
  an annotated list of queries, or search filters.

  * *Resources* are things put into the system to help people participate in the Rakontu, either to help them tell 
  stories or to provide useful information. Resources might include getting started guides as well as information about 
  a geographical community or pictures related to a subject.

Entries, because they are more like documents (things people create) than utterances (things people say), can be saved as drafts (kept private) or published to the group. All entries can be changed (forever) by their creators, and their histories can be seen by everyone.

== Annotations

Annotations are things that surround entries for the purpose of discussion and collective awareness.

  * *Comments* are just things people wanted to say in reaction to a story (or invitation, collage, pattern, or resource). 
  These will be familiar to people who have used any online community software.

  * *Requests* are a special kind of comment that asks other people to do something related to an entry -- translate a story 
  to another language, read a story out loud, transcribe an audio story, or just add some comments.

  * *Nudges* are ratings. When a Rakontu member nudges a story or other entry up or down, everyone sees the entry as 
  higher or lower in their Rakontu's home page. The nudge system is similar to SlashDot's karma system, in that people gain 
  nudge points by participating in the Rakontu and can use them to nudge entries up or down. The main difference between 
  Rakontu's rating system and others, however, is that any Rakontu can define up to five unique _categories_ of nudges. This helps 
  people distinguish between entries that are useful for different reasons.

  * *Tags* on entries can be used to build an open-ended and changing set of descriptors for finding helpful things.

Annotations, because they are more like utterances (things people say) than documents (things people create), can never be saved as drafts or changed, and they have no histories.

== Answers

Each type of entry (story, invitation, collage, pattern, resource) has a set of questions you can answer about entries of that type. 
The creator of the entry _and_ everyone else in the Rakontu can answer the same questions. Looking at differences of 
opinion about stories can be a useful way to think about issues in the Rakontu. It's also a great way to find stories 
you are interested in reading.

Members can also have questions they answer. These answers can be combined with questions about stories to produce 
interesting queries, like "Show me stories told by members under 20 in which people said they felt sad."

Answers, like annotations, are utterances that cannot be saved as drafts or changed and have no histories.

[The Rakontu Nudge System]
Category=Using Rakontu
Order in category=1
Interpret as=Wiki markup
For new members=no
Help resource=yes
Managers only=no
Rakontu uses a ratings system similar to SlashDot's karma system (with a few elaborations) called the *nudge* system. The idea is that Rakontu members nudge stories and other entries up and down in the timeline, making a sort of matrix of meaning where things nearer the surface are more important _for one reason or another_. Nudging in Rakontu has more to do with utility for particular purposes than with simple popularity.

The people who set up your Rakontu also set up from one to five nudge *categories*, or axes of meaning. Anyone can nudge an item up or down in any of the Rakontu categories, and you can shift your view of the timeline depending on what you care about at the time. These are similar to moderation categories on SlashDot, except that every small group can set their own meanings. 

You gain "nudge points" by participating in the Rakontu -- telling stories, adding comments, answering questions, and so on -- which you can use to nudge stories up and down. Exactly how many nudge points you accumulate may have been customized by your Rakontu managers. Some Rakontus might be more interested in having people tell stories while others are more interested in comments and question answering. You can find out what influences nudge point accumulation in your Rakontu by looking at the Visit - About this Rakontu page.

[Timelines in Rakontu]

For new members=no
Help resource=yes
Managers only=no

The home page of your Rakontu, as well as the pages for each entry, member and character, shows things in timelines. Besides the time dimension, which is left to right (most recent to the right), there are two other dimensions:

  # Top-to-bottom placement shows how high or low each entry falls on the "nudge" rating system, with the highest-nudged items towards the top: good things "float up." 
  # The size of each item's text shows how much activity has taken place around the item. Things people are paying attention to have "buzz." 

You can think of a timeline as sort of like a "stream" of stories and other items that the group is collectively building and talking about. The items most important to the group will usually be recent (toward the right), of high value (toward the top) and big (of high activity). The same timeline appears on the page for each entry and for member pages (and character pages, if your Rakontu has characters). 

Where nudges, tag sets, comments, requests, answers and links are shown on timelines, their height and size show the nudge value and activity level of the entry they are associated with _when they were added to it_, not at the current time. This means that when you are looking at an entry page you can see how it changed in nudge value and activity level as annotations were added to it.

=== Changing the horizontal (time) view

In the home page and on member/character pages, you can change what time span you want to see by clicking on the buttons in the options above the timeline. To refresh the timeline to show new items that might have been recently added, click the ">|" button. This will set the right side of the timeline to the present moment. To go back to the first entries in the Rakontu (or when the member joined the Rakontu, or when the entry was created), click the "|<" button. 

=== Changing the vertical (nudge) view

In all timelines you can change the meaning of the vertical dimension by changing which categories are checked in the "Nudges" area of the options below the timeline. For example, if (at the moment) you care more about importance than appropriateness, you can ignore appropriate/inappropriate nudges, and items will shift around accordingly. The managers of your Rakontu should set up nudge categories that are particularly meaningful to your group (and you should feel free to suggest useful categories!). 

You can also set a nudge "floor" so that you can ignore items that have been rated below a certain level. To do this, change the number labeled "Hide entries below" and click Change. (Rakontu will save your preference for the next time you visit.)

[Publishing Entries]
Category=Using Rakontu
Order in category=3
For new members=no
Help resource=yes
Interpret as=Wiki markup
Managers only=no
When you tell a story in Rakontu, you create an *entry* in the system. Likewise, an invitation, pattern, collage or resource is also an entry. Any type of entry can be *published* so that everyone can read and comment on it, or it can be saved as a *draft* which only you can see. To see your saved drafts, choose My stuff - Drafts. 

You can change any entry you have created, forever, whether it is a draft or not. To change a published entry, go to the page that displays entry and find the link that says "Change" just after the entry text. Make your changes, then click Publish again. All changes to entries (draft or not) are visible in the *show history* area of the entry's page, though you can remove old versions through the drafts screen.

You can also *unpublish* an entry, meaning that you can remove it from view and put it back into your own drafts list. To unpublish an entry, click the Unpublish button while changing a published entry. Once you do this not only the entry but also all annotations to it will be removed from view. 

You can also invite other members of your Rakontu to edit your entry with you by adding *additional editors*. You can choose either particular members or groups of members by role (all curators and guides, for example). Shared editing is particularly useful for resources, or if two people want to tell a story together. Any entry you create will always remain linked to you and will show your name only; and you are the only one who can remove it from your drafts.

[Searching in Your Rakontu]
Category=Using Rakontu
Order in category=4
For new members=no
Help resource=yes
Interpret as=Wiki markup
Managers only=no

All searching in Rakontu is done by creating and using search *filters*. When you search using filters, you don't go to a separate "search results" page with a simple list of matching items. Instead, you _change_ what is shown on the same timelines you see on your Rakontu's home page and on each member's page (and character pages if your Rakontu has characters). In this way you can move back and forth through time and see the nudge levels (height) and activity levels (size) of items while you are looking at a subset of items based on your search.

Members of your Rakontu can *share* some of the search filters they create. Shared search filters can be used by everyone, but they can only be changed by their creators. Shared filters can also be used as elements in patterns. To use a shared filter, look at the list of filters in the "Search filters" area of the options below any of the timelines. If there are no shared search filters, you'll just see something saying there are no filters and that you can make one.

To make a new search filter, click on "Make new filter" in the options section below the timeline on the home or member/character pages. You can search on:

  * The title and/or text of the entry
  * Texts in annotations such as comments, requests, nudges, or links
  * Tags 
  * Answers to questions about stories and other entries
  * Answers to questions about the people (or characters) who told the stories

And you can combine these search elements in any way you like. For example, you might want to find stories in which people said they were happy about the outcome, were over 60, and said the word "bureaucracy" in their story. 

All searches are case insensitive.

[Building a Story Collage]

A story collage is an annotated list of entries that you want to highlight for some reason: top ten stories for new members to read, or five invitations you want people to notice, or the result of an exercise where people chose stories most useful for learning about particular topics. (In future versions of Rakontu we would like to support more elaborate methods of building collages; but for now the simple annotated list is what a collage can be.)

To build a story collage, choose "Build a story collage" from the Create menu. Most of the screen will look the same as that when you enter a story, except that you can choose stories to add, and add a comment as to why you are adding each one. Collages, like stories, patterns, invitations and resources, can have comments, requests, nudges, and tags added to them; and they can be linked to other collages (and invitations, etc). 

[Describing a Pattern]

Order in category=6
Interpret as=Wiki markup
For new members=no
Help resource=yes
Managers only=no

A pattern is an observation about something you've noticed in your story museum. Perhaps there are fewer stories about crime than you expected, or when you searched for stories about crime you found more than you expected about neighbors helping neighbors. A pattern is a way to talk to each other about the story collection you have built together. Patterns typically link to one or more search filters, possibly contrasting them. For example, you might say: "I noticed that if you show stories where people said they were indifferent, you get a lot about the park, but if you search for stories where people said they felt frustrated, the stories are mostly about the beach. Why is that?" And then people can add comments to discuss it.

To create a pattern, choose "Describe a pattern" from the Create menu. Type in an explanation of what you noticed, and if you like, choose some shared search filters to include in the pattern. You can only used *shared* filters, so if you noticed something using your private filters you need to change the filter to switch it to sharing. Like stories, patterns can have comments, requests, nudges, and tags added to them; and they can be linked to other patterns (and invitations, etc). 

[How to Be a Curator]
Category= Helping
Order in category=1
Interpret as=Wiki markup
For new members=yes
Help resource=yes
Managers only=no
Curating a Rakontu means helping to tend the museum of stories (and things that surround them). Are the stories
and other information in good order? Is it all as useful as it could be? Can people find what they need when they need it?
Are there loose ends, broken links, dead wood?  People who like organizing "stuff" are good curators. 

There are three main activities you might do as a curator: filling gaps, flagging things that should be removed, and 
maintaining consistency.

=== Filling gaps

As a curator you should look around the Rakontu frequently just checking on activity. The Gaps page (Curate->Gaps) can help you find places that might need attention. These are the things listed on the Gaps page.

  # *Untagged entries*. Entries with no tags are less likely to be found when people are searching on tags. Filling these in, especially
  for items with high nudge values (therefore important or useful) or high activity, 
  will help the whole set of entries become more useful.
  # *Unlinked entries*. Links between entries help people go from one story to another finding things that are useful in different
  ways. One of the most helpful things curators can do is notice similarities between stories and link them together
  so that people can move from one to another. 
  # *Entries with no answers to questions*. As with tags, entries that have no answers to questions are harder to find. If the teller of the story didn't answer any questions about it, you can still answer some as a curator. 
  # *Collages with no links to stories*. Collages with no story links might have linked to stories that have been removed from the system. These should either be removed or updated.

=== Flagging items

You can flag every type of entry (story, invitation, collage, pattern, resource), annotation (comment, request, tag set,
nudge) and answer, as well as search filters.

To flag an entry or any of its annotations or answers, click on the entry on the Rakontu's home
page, then click the "Curate" button in the Other Options area.
After you click "Go," the page will redisplay with little green flags next to each item. Click any flag to mark the
item as inappropriate or unhelpful. 

To flag a search filter, select it on the home page, then click Change. In the page that shows the details
of the filter, click Flag.

To view all of the flags you have marked, choose Flags from the Curate menu at the top of the page. 
  * If you are a manager of the Rakontu, you can either unflag items or remove them from the Rakontu. 
  * If you are not a manager, you can unflag items or notify the Rakontu manager(s) that the items should be removed. 
  Notification is mainly to let managers know if something is particularly in need of removal (obscene or hate speech, for example). 
  It's best not to over use notification if you want the managers to pay attention when you _do_ need to get their attention.
  
*Flagging items through attachments*

Because entries can have attachments (like email) it can sometimes be hard to see if someone has added something
offensive or just huge and not helpful. (Many large attachments can slow down access to the Rakontu.) It's a good
idea to keep an eye on attachments in a separate list. To review attachments, choose Curate->Attachments. You can then
flag the entry that goes with any attachment as needing review.

=== Maintaining tags

Rakontu managers can decide whether they want curators (meaning, everybody) to be able to be change the tags on
existing entries. This is very useful if you want to maintain consistency in your tags, for example fixing misspellings
and changing plurals (like "cats" to "cat") so that tags match up during searches. However, if your Rakontu is
particularly large or widespread your managers may have decided not to allow this. Check your Curate menu
to see if there is a Tags option there. If there isn't and you want one, ask a manager about it. 

[How to Be a Guide]
Category= Helping
Order in category=2
Interpret as=Wiki markup
For new members=yes
Help resource=yes
Managers only=no
Being a Rakontu guide means paying attention to the people side of things. Are people getting what they want out of it?
Are they confused? Are they interested? Motivated? Contributing? People who are "people people" are good guides.

There are three main things guides do: answer questions, help people find their way around, and monitor responses.

=== Answering questions

First: all guides must be willing to accept emails from the Rakontu and be listed on the Help page to answer
questions people have about the Rakontu.

When you become a guide, you should enter a paragraph or so into your preferences page that tells people
what sorts of questions you can answer well. Perhaps you know a lot about the history of your community,
or you are a "techie" and can help them with system problems, or you can help them write good stories.
Writing a good *guide introduction* can help people find the answers they need, and it can help you
avoid getting questions you can't answer or find boring. 

=== Helping people find their way around

Rakontu guides are in charge of on-line help for Rakontu members. As a guide, you can 
create and maintain *resources* that help people find their way around and contribute to your Rakontu
in a positive way. For example,
maintaining a frequently-asked-questions list about how your group works is a good way to help
people who have questions like "What sorts of nicknames are people supposed to use?" and
"How many shared search filters should I make?" and so on. A "news" resource that highlights the latest activity
is also helpful. To review your resources, choose Resources from the Guide menu.

=== Monitoring responses

There are two main types of response in Rakontu: telling a story in response to an invitation, and doing something
in response to a request about a particular story (or other type of entry). For example, people might ask
others to transcribe an audio story, read a written story out loud, translate a story into another language,
and so on. As a guide, you will want to
check on whether there are invitations or requests that have been "orphaned" and need some attention. 

To review invitations or requests, choose one of these items in your Guide menu. You can either look only
at invitations or requests with no reponses or all of them. For requests, you can mark them as completed
if you see that they have been satisfied.

[How to Be a Liaison]
Category=Helping
Order in category=3
Interpret as=Wiki markup
For new members=yes
Help resource=yes
Managers only=no
In some communities or groups, not everyone is able and willing to use the internet. For building and maintaining a 
collection of stories, this is more important than it is for (say) trading advice. In particular, older people often
tell the best and most precious stories but are less likely to be online. In a similar way, the people in a community
most likely to be heard online are those with the means and skills to use a computer. One of the purposes of Rakontu
is to help people bridge the social divide while building their story collections. The primary way it does this is
by helping *liaisons* use Rakontu in a special way.

= Managing off-line members

Each off-line member of a Rakontu has a liaison assigned to them. A member's liaison can change their their picture and description, keep and save their drafts, and relay messages to them via email.  To make changes to off-line members, choose "Manage off-line members" from the Liaise menu. You can add new members, inactivate existing members (for whom you have responsibility), and transfer responsibility to another liaison.

Be aware that when you assume responsibility for an off-line member, any message an on-line member sends to them will come through you. You will be responsible for showing (or reading) the message to the off-line member and sending back their response.

= Adding stories collected off-line

You can enter up to ten stories at a time in a "batch" mode. This is primarily for the situation in which you have interviewed several people at, say, a retirement home, aid shelter, conference, or other place where people are not going to be using the system as on-line members. Liaisons who are not also managers can enter stories told by any of their assigned off-line members. 

Managers have the option of entering stories for *any* members of the Rakontu, including on-line members. This option is primarily meant to help people "seed" the Rakontu by entering some stories collected in a workshop or via interviews. 

To enter stories, choose "Add a batch of stories" from the Liaise menu. Enter each story, along with an optional comment and tag set. Or, you can type your stories into a spreadsheet, save the file in CSV format (with Unicode text encoding) and choose the file in the batch screen. The CSV story entry format is:

^"nickname", "YYYY-MM-DD", "story", "title", "text"^

The third column will usually be "story," but it can be any entry type. (Note that during CSV import you cannot use translated names; they must be in English.) So in fact you can use CSV import to include all types of entry, while in the batch entry screen you can only enter stories. CSV import is more flexible but less powerful, because you cannot enter answers to questions, comments or tags via CSV import.

When a batch of stories (or other entries) has been read, either using the batch entry screen or via CSV import, the entries are in a "buffer" and not in the main data set as yet. This is in case you make a mistake and need to fix it before truly importing the entries. To review batch-entered stories, choose "Review entered batches" from the Liaise menu. In that screen you can make changes to the stories (but not the answers, comments, and tag sets) and fully import entries or delete them.

= Printing stories for off-line members to read

Entering stories is only half of what liaisons do. The other half is bringing stories from the on-line community to off-line members to read or hear. To do this, you can print stories or other entries and take them to wherever your off-line members are. You don't print stories from the Liaise menu; you print them from the main "home" screen. In the section marked "Other options" there should be a "Print" button (which only appears if you are a liaison). Click that button to print whatever selection of stories or other entries you are looking at in the home screen. Using this in combination with a search filter and other choices, you can print only what you think your off-line members would be most interested in hearing about.

You can also print all of the responses to a story -- answers to questions, comments, requests, tag sets, nudges. When you are looking at a story, choose "Print content and annotations for this story". This can be a good way to show people responses to stories they told.

= Entering off-line member responses to stories

You can also enter responses your off-line members have given -- comments, answers, requests, tag sets, nudges -- to stories you have shown or read them. For example, you might take a story to ten different off-line members and ask each of them to answer some questions about it, then enter those answers as annotations to the story. Or people might have a request about a story, or people might want to respond to an invitation. Just start entering things into the system as though you yourself were saying them. The entry form should say "Since you are a liaison" and give you some choices about who said the thing you are entering. Off-line members can even attribute their contributions to characters (if your Rakontu is using them), just as on-line members do.

<p>You can use wiki-style markup in almost all the large text boxes in Rakontu (all those that have an "interpret as" choice).</p>

<p>Separate paragraphs with blank lines.</p>

<p>To write bold text, put asterisks around it: *bold text* becomes <b>bold text</b>.</p>

<p>To write italic text, put underscores around it: _italic text_ becomes <i>italic text</i>.</p>

<p>To write fixed-width text, put those little hat characters around it: ^code text^ becomes <code>code text</code>.</p>

<p>To write struck-out text, put tildes around it: ~strikeout text~ becomes <del> strikeout text</del>.</p>

<p>To write a heading, put one equals sign at the start of the line, followed by a space: </p><p>= header 1 text</p><p>
becomes <h1>&nbsp; &nbsp; header 1 text</h1><p>

<p>To write a sub-heading, put two equals signs: </p><p>== header 2 text</p><p>becomes <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; header 2 text</h2></p>

<p>To write a third-level heading, put three equals signs: </p><p>=== header 3 text</p><p>becomes <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; header 3 text</h3></p>

<p>To write an unordered (bullet) list item, put an asterisk with two spaces before it. Keep two spaces in front of every line
in each list item (if they spill over), thus:</p><p>&nbsp; * unordered list item</p><p>&nbsp; continuation of line</p><p>
becomes <ul><li>unordered list item continuation of line</li></ul> </p>

<p>To write an ordered (numbered) list item, put a pound sign with two spaces before it. Keep two spaces in front of every line
in each list item (if they spill over), thus:</p><p>&nbsp; # ordered list item</p><p>&nbsp; continuation of  line</p><p>
becomes <ol><li>ordered list item continuation of line</li></ol> </p>

<p>To write a horizontal line (hr), put four or more dashes on a line by themselves:</p><p>----</p><p>becomes</p><p><hr></p>

<p>To write a link, put square brackets around it: [http://www.rakontu.org]

[Managing Rakontu Members]
Category=Managing
Order in category=1
Interpret as=Wiki markup
For new members=yes
Help resource=yes
Managers only=yes
Managers in a Rakontu are responsible for the Rakontu -- for who belongs to it, what is (and isn't) allowed into it, and how it appears to members. Usually two or three people will share the management for a Rakontu, though sometimes this will be only one person. If you are the only manager of your Rakontu, you are also the owner, which means that you are the only person (other than the site administrator) who can inactivate it.

To review and control memberships in your Rakontu, choose "Members" from the Manage menu.

People cannot join Rakontus by clicking on a link; a manager must invite them. To invite new members, type their emails into the "Add new members" area. Each added email *must* be a valid email with a Google account connected to it. When you add a new member, their email will appear in the "Pending members" area until they first visit the group. You can send them a link to the Rakontu which they can click on, at which time they will become a full member.

Each member can optionally be a manager or an owner. Any manager can make any other member a manager or owner of the Rakontu. You should only ask people to be managers if you trust them not to abuse the privilege. You can make someone a manager or owner (or remove the role) by changing the "Membership role" area next to their name, then clicking Save changes.

When a member no longer wants to participate in the Rakontu, you can inactivate them (usually at their request). Simply check the "Inactivate" box next to the member and click Save changes. Inactivated members don't disappear completely, but go into an inactivated list. This is so that the stories they told will not have "dead links" to a non-existent member (instead the stories will say they were told by "the former member so-and-so"). Inactivated members can be reinstated simply by copying their (Google-account-related) email and pasting it back into the "Add new members" area. When the email matches (exactly) the former member will regain all of their old preferences.

[Managing Helping Roles in Your Rakontu]
Category=Managing
Order in category=2
Interpret as=Wiki markup
For new members=no
Help resource=yes
Managers only=yes
Any Rakontu has three helping roles: curator, guide and liaison. Curators and guides are meant to address the dichotomy of how people get involved in online groups: some are drawn to taking care of "things" (posts, metadata, wiki pages) and some are drawn to taking care of people (by leading discussions, answering questions, writing FAQs). So, why not create two contrapositioned roles and let people gravitate to using them?

The liaison role exists purely to serve one of Rakontu's main goals, which is to create a bridge between the on-line and off-line social worlds. To quote a sentence from Rakontu's design document: "The physical-digital split means that older people tell stories at the community center while younger people tell them on Facebook." If your Rakontu doesn't bridge on-line and off-line worlds, you can ignore the liaison role.

Why have helping roles at all? Because there are often people in a group who don't want to take on the _responsibility_ of making important decisions for the group (managing it) but _are_ willing to put some time and energy into helping out. In essence Rakontu allows a wider spread of responsibility throughout the group -- even extending to the point where everyone in the whole group can be doing _something_ extra.

=== Banning members from roles

All the helping roles are purely voluntary. Any member can take them on or relinquish them at any time. Usually this is fine; but if anyone in the group abuses these roles (for example becoming a curator to bother a person by flagging all of their entries) you can bar them from the role. Simply change what is checked in the "Helping roles available" area in the "Active members" table. (Note that you cannot bar managers from taking on any of the helping roles. The assumption is that if they are a manager they are trustworthy enough to take on the lesser helping roles.)

=== Role read-before messages

To help people understand the helping roles and their importance in your own particular Rakontu, you can set your own "read-before" messages about each role (find these in the "Helping role texts" section of the Appearance page). These will appear in each member's Preferences page as they decide whether to take on the roles. If there are special things you want people to do, you can put them here.

=== The curators and tags decision

Member-contributed tags can help to organize stories for quick finding. However, people sometimes misspell words in tags, or they type "cats" when "cat" is already available, and as a result tag lists tend to get cluttered. Keeping the tag list clean and easy to use is a great way to maintain order in your story museum. For this reason, Rakontu has a screen under the Curate menu in which you can see and edit every single tag in the system in one place. By default, only curators _who are also managers_ can access this screen. If you trust everyone in your group, you can make it so that any curator (meaning, any member, since anyone can become a curator instantly) can change every tag. 

[Managing Your Rakontu's Appearance]
Category=Managing
Order in category=3
Interpret as=Wiki markup
For new members=yes
Help resource=yes
Managers only=yes
To review and control your Rakontu's appearance, choose "Appearance" from the Manage menu.

There are three main areas of your Rakontu's appearance, any or all of which you may want to customize: its identity, text details, and look. The identity of the Rakontu is in its name, picture and tag line (short descriptive text). All of these appear at the top of each page in the Rakontu.

The text details of a Rakontu are its description, welcome message, etiquette statement, and helping role texts. Using either the Wiki format or simple HTML, you can include links and images in these texts and make them as short or long as you like. You can use these to tell people what the Rakontu is for, where they should look for other info (web site? discussion group?), and how they should behave while using it.

The look of the Rakontu is set by its skin. You can choose from available skins, build your own, or ignore skins entirely and use your own CSS page to change the look of your Rakontu entirely. To build your own skin, simply replace the entries in the "Custom skin" box (on the Settings page) with other fonts and colors. (You can find lists of hex colors on many web sites; type "hex colors" to find them.) To use a separate CSS file, see the help entry on that topic.

[Managing Your Rakontu's Nudge System]
Category=Managing
Order in category=4
Interpret as=Wiki markup
For new members=yes
Help resource=yes
Managers only=yes
What's a nudge system? It's a way for people in a Rakontu to collectively sort through their stories and decide what's important and what's not. It's sort of like the popularity/rating systems on many social web sites, with one major difference. When people are telling stories, abstract measures of "quality" -- like what is a "good story" -- are not as important as measures of utility -- like what story is useful for what. In fact, setting up quality ratings is a sure way to kill storytelling, because when you do that two things happen: some people don't tell stories because they are afraid theirs won't be "good enough," and other people take over the storytelling because they believe themselves to be exceptionally entertaining. For most groups, Rakontu won't be about out-telling each other; it will be about building something useful together. 

Probably the one most important thing you can do as a manager (or you all as managers) is to set up good nudge categories that suit your group. What is your collective goal? Do you want to resolve conflicts? Get to know each other better? Remember old times? Help new people feel more comfortable? Pursue a common goal, like building (or fighting) a planned development? Or just have some fun? You should use some of your nudge categories for marking stories (and other entries) that help with these goals.

Two nudge categories that are almost always useful are *appropriateness* and *importance*. An appropriateness measure will push off-topic and rude/offensive stories to the bottom of the timeline (though offensive stories can also be flagged by curators). An importance measure separates "telling" stories that have a big impact, like "The day I found out where my cancer came from" from trivial ones like "The cat did a funny trick today." How important the importance measure is will depend on your group. If your Rakontu is just about being silly together, maybe you don't need an importance measure, and maybe a "silliness" measure will be more useful. You decide what matters.

Writing good nudge category questions is also important, so that people know what they are rating. Make sure the categories and questions are not confusing!

Note that nudge categories are linked to stories _by order, not by name_; so if you change the names (and even meanings) of your nudge categories, the old nudges will connect to the new names. For this reason, it's a good idea to set up your nudge categories early, and only make small clarifying changes later. Otherwise you risk making existing nudges meaningless or even misleading.

People gain points for nudging entries by doing things in the Rakontu. The result is that those who participate more get a louder voice when it comes to saying what matters and what doesn't. This is a spur to participation, but more importantly it means that people can't get a disproportionate voice based on any other characteristics (powerful position, for example). Depending on what you want people to do, you can weight different activities high or low in nudge point accumulation. For example, if you really want people to answer questions about stories, you can set the "answering question" nudge point accumulation number high -- say 10 points per question. Or maybe you really want people to tell stories more than anything else -- just set the "adding story" number high. 

By the way, if you don't like the nudge point accumulations (too "game-y"?) and you want people to get points just for existing, set a ridiculously high rate on any category you expect people to use often -- say set "reading" to 500. Then everyone will have far more nudge points than they could ever use, and you will have effectively disabled the system.

[Managing Your Rakontu's Activity System]

The activity system of a Rakontu is just a device that makes some titles appear larger than others in the Rakontu home page timeline. The purpose of this is to show people which entries have more "buzz" around them and provide social awareness.

You can decide what sorts of activities should produce the most "buzz" by changing the numbers in the section under "Activity system" in the Settings page. For example, if you want people to particularly notice invitations, you might put a high number under "adding invitation." This will influence the starting size of every invitation created. Or, if you want people to particularly notice the building of links between entries, you could increase the numbers under each of the link-related items in the list. 

If you don't want any entry titles to appear larger than others, set all of the activity numbers to zero. This will effectively disable the activity system.

[Characters in Your Rakontu]
Category=Managing
Order in category=6
Interpret as=Wiki markup
For new members=yes
Help resource=yes
Managers only=yes
People often find it easier to tell stories, especially sensitive but important ones, when they don't have to admit openly who is telling them. This is especially true if the story makes the teller look silly or stupid, or makes the teller vulnerable to any kind of discriminatory attention. Using characters is a way to help people tell the stories that need to be told in a safe way. For example, if I just broke something and want to warn others not to do the same thing I did, I might be more willing to tell my cautionary tale if I can say that "All-Thumbs Fred" did it than if I have to admit my offense. Mistake and regret stories are often even more useful than brag-worthy stories, if you want to learn something from each other.

If you want to use characters, think about what characters are particularly useful for your community or group. What sorts of stories do you want to bring out? For example, if you want to help each other learn how to do something, having characters at the extremes of knowledge -- the know-it-all and the newbie, for example -- can bring out useful voices. Or say you want to unite people on both sides of a contentious issue; you might create characters who have extreme views on the issues. The "little bird" character can be useful if you want people to be able to talk about rumors without having to say where they heard them.

Of course some things about designing characters hold for all groups. The best characters are *extreme* -- encyclopedically smart, ridiculously stupid, monstrously irritating, saintly perfect. Extremes make it clear that people are "putting on" a role for the purpose of saying something they would normally hide, and that the role is artificial, temporary, and purposeful. Good characters are also *funny* (unless it is inappropriate, of course). Humor makes it obvious that the whole character thing is a useful device for bringing up sensitive topics, not a way to cloak obnoxious or offensive speech. Pretend you are listening to a stand-up comedian taking on the persona of a character you'd like to hear from, and write what you hear.

You can set whether to allow character attribution for each type of entry and annotation. For example, it makes sense that people should be able to tell _stories_ as though a character were speaking. Invitations, comments and nudges are also things that people might be afraid to speak out in their own voice on. However, you might want to extend anonymity to collages and patterns, or even tags, if you think those things might also be sensitive. Or you might want to allow anonymity for stories only. 

If characters will not be useful to your group, the best thing to do is to remove any default characters you see; the whole character system will disappear.

=== On anonymity and characters

You as a manager should be clear (in case people ask) that nothing in Rakontu is fully anonymous, since a Rakontu system administrator can always query the database and find out which member actually added the material. However, for the most part and without extra effort character attribution is anonymous. 

If you need _truly_ anonymous entry, you can still get it by creating one or more fake off-line members, perhaps simply called "Anonymous." If you attribute collected stories to these off-line members _without_ keeping track of where the stories actually came from, nobody, including yourself, will be able to track the stories back to their sources. 

[Your Rakontu's Questions]
Category=Managing
Order in category=7
Interpret as=Wiki markup
For new members=yes
Help resource=yes
Managers only=yes
Questions may be the most important part of your Rakontu. Asking people to answer questions about the stories they tell, and about other elements of the system, can help people explain things to each other. Also, looking at patterns across stories and members can help your group find out some amazing things about patterns of collective meaning in the group. For example, say you find out that only members over 50 told stories in which the tag "health care" co-occurred with a positive outcome, or that only members with dogs told stories about nasty cats, or so on. Finding useful patterns together can help you achieve common goals.

You can set up questions about each type of entry (stories, invitations, collages, patterns and resources). You can ask people questions about themselves as well. Combining entry and member questions in search filters is useful, so you should make sure you have at least a few questions about each entry type and about members. Your Rakontu will most likely start out with some default questions (depending on your site installation). There are also some sample questions you can look at or copy for inspiration. You can also trade questions with other Rakontus using CSV import and export.  

=== Reviewing your question sets

To change your Rakontu's questions, choose "Questions" from the Manage menu. You can use the questions-list page to review how your questions are performing, because it counts up for you how many people have answered each question. If you see for example that one question out of five is never answered, you might want to ask a few people why they didn't answer it and consider rewording it. To change any set of questions, click the Change link on the questions list page. 

=== Changing the questions in a set

To add new questions, type them in the top box on the page for questions of that type. Place each question name on a separate line, then click "Save changes". You can add details afterward.

You can disable questions by clicking on the check mark (it will change to a red X mark). Click again to enable the question again. You can set the order of questions in that category by clicking the up and down arrows.

Note that you cannot (ever) remove a question entirely. This is because answers retain links to questions to find out where they belong. Disabled questions do not appear in search screens and are not asked; but you can recall them (and search on them again) at any time.

=== Changing a question

To change questions you have already created, click on a question name while viewing the question set. 

The available question types are:

  * boolean: yes or no (a check box)
  * text: free text words (a text box)
  * ordinal: choices in order (checkboxes if multiple, drop-down list if single)
  * nominal: choices not in any particular order (checkboxes if multiple, drop-down list if single)
  * value: a number (a text box)

Note that there is not actually any difference between ordinal and nominal questions. The distinction is a placeholder in case we want to add a distinction in later versions of Rakontu. Note also that value entry is a simple text box -- hopefully it will be a fancy slider at some point in the future.

The name, text and explanation deserve some extra mention:

  * The question's *name* is what appears in the search-filter page and when details are being hidden in the timelines. It's basically a description of the question when space is short. These should be brief but tell you what the question is about.
  * The question's *text* is what people are actually asked when they are typing in a story or other entry, or answering questions about themselves. 
  * The question's *explanation* is an optional extra bit of text that you can use to help people understand a confusing question. Don't overuse it, because if you do your question list will get too long and too boring. But if people tell you a question is hard to understand, you can add clarification here. The explanation appears after the question proper in italics.

If a question has choices, you can change the choices at any time. However, if you remove an available choice, people won't be able to search on it anymore, so answers with that choice will never be found again. (That may or may not be what you want to happen.)

=== Removing a question

If you don't want to use a question anymore, check the box to inactivate it. You can't remove a question entirely, ever. The reason for  this is that the answers people tell are objects in the database, and they are linked to question objects. If you delete a question object the answers would link to nothing, and you'd never be able to link them up again. Inactivated questions go into a sort of pool where you can recall them if you need to search on them again. If you don't like how a question reads, it's better to change the text of the question rather than inactivate it, _unless_ you need to change the _meaning_ of the question. 

=== Advice on question writing

  * Be careful to word the question so that both the people who tell the stories and those who are reading other people's stories can make sense of it. For example, don't include the question, "How do you feel about the story you just told?" -- because some of the people will be looking at _someone else's_ story. (That's one of the best parts of Rakontu, that people can record their own opinions about other people's stories.)
  * People are rarely willing to answer very many questions about anything. The more questions you ask, the more information you might _appear_ to be getting, but be careful: the _quality_ of the information will go down. People are famous for "clicking past" things when they get bored. The best number of questions per entry is no less than three and no more than five, or seven if you think people are really committed to contributing. 
  * All question answering in Rakontu is optional; you can't _require_ anybody to answer any question. (Why? Because it improves the quality of the answers you _do_ get.)
  * It's often a good idea to have a "I don't know" or "I can't remember" or "I'm not sure" answer in any list of choices. You don't need an "I don't want to say" answer, because they can just decline to answer the question; but you can have one if you like.

As of this writing, Rakontu resides on the Google App Engine, which sets some limitations on the volume of use and speed of operation. Because of this, Rakontu also has limitations. Two are important:

  # No Rakontu can have more than 1000 entries (stories + invitations + patterns + collages + resources). For most small groups this limit will not be a problem. If you run up against this limit, you can remove older items to make room for more.
  # For pages with timelines (home, entry, member, character), if the number of items selected exceeds a constant (set at the site level, by default 200), the number of items shown will be truncated (and the page will say so). To reduce the number, make different selections in the time range or types of items.

[Using an external style sheet to style your Rakontu]
Category=Technical
Order in category=3
Interpret as=Wiki markup
For new members=no
Help resource=yes
Managers only=yes
By using an external style sheet (hosted on a URL somewhere) you can dramatically change the appearance of your Rakontu. Just type a valid CSS URL in the Appearance page for your Rakontu. The standard Rakontu style sheet is loaded _before_ (not instead of) your style sheet, so you can override only those elements you want to change.

The best way to change the way things appear on Rakontu pages is simply to look at the page source of any page you like and consider the classes and divisions shown there. You can also look directly at the style sheet Rakontu uses, which is called "base.css" and is located in the directory "stylesheets" under your Rakontu's main URL. 

=== Basic elements, classes and divisions

The element classes defined for a Rakontu page (all of which are self-explanatory) are:

  * img.bordered
  * table.fullwidth (used only in the menus table)
  * table.noborder (used in lots of places where borderless tables are wanted)
  * td.noborder (same as borderless table)
  * ul li.nobullet

In addition, some non-element classes (<div class="">) are:

  * .rightalign (used to put things off to the right)
  * .blurb (used for entry texts and other "inset" things to be read)
  * .indented (only used in a few places where things should be set off, but not with a special color)

Defined divisions (<div id="">) are as follows:

  * #header (top of page)
  * #footer (bottom of page)
  * #content (everything else)

=== Top menus
 
The menus at the top of Rakontu pages use several divisions to create a CSS-only menu (though it does use Javascript for the IE6 condition only). This technique comes by the way from [http://www.cssnewbie.com/easy-css-dropdown-menus (Easy CSS DropdownMenus)] at cssnewbie.com (thanks folks!).

  * #topmenu
  * #topmenu li
  * #topmenu li:hover ul, #topmenu li.hover ul 
  * #topmenu li:hover li, #topmenu li.hover li 
  * #topmenu li a 
  * #topmenu li ul
  * #topmenu li:hover li a, #topmenu li.hover a
  * #topmenu li li
  * #topmenu li li a:hover

=== Forms

Forms are handled with one of two classes *.rakontu_form_centered* (used only on the start page and the "create new Rakontu" admin form) and *.rakontu_form* (used on all other forms).

The division "rakontu_form_style" encircles all forms. It includes specifications for the elements *label*, *select*, *input* and *textarea*. There is also a ":hover" style for each of these.

There are two classes of form-input submit styles: *input.button* and *input.button_small*, again each with its ":hover". The smaller buttons are used on the timelines or any place where an option is being chosen that is not the main point of the page.

=== Image buttons

There are a few image buttons that rely on background images from the CSS, thus:

  * #rakontu_form_style input.flag_red (uses URL/images/flag_red.png)
  * #rakontu_form_style input.flag_green (uses URL/images/flag_green.png)
  * #rakontu_form_style input.move_up (uses URL/images/arrow_up.png)
  * #rakontu_form_style input.move_down (uses URL/images/arrow_down.png)
  * #rakontu_form_style input.active (uses URL/images/accept.png)
  * #rakontu_form_style input.inactive (uses URL/images/cancel.png)

If you use a custom style sheet and want to override the styles for these buttons, you should either copy these image files to the place where the style sheet is found, or reference them via the full URL. 

Note that all of these image buttons require a :hover specification of "border:none" because otherwise they get an ugly border around them when you hover over them. (Unless you like that.)
