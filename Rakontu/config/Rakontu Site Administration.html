<h3>Backup and restore using AppRocket</h3>

<p>AppRocket is an open source library that backs up and restores a Google App Engine datastore to/from a MySQL
database. Using AppRocket you can keep a copy of your
Rakontu database on your local machine in case of any problems, or you can do stuff with
the data in SQL. </p>

<p>To backup using AppRocket, do these things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install a MySQL server on your local computer. Set up a user with a password for AppRocket to use.</li>
<li>Edit the file <code>config.py</code> on your Rakontu GAE site so that it has the correct entries in the
<code>MYSQL DATABASE CONFIGURATION</code> section of the file.
<pre>
# MYSQL DATABASE CONFIGURATION
DATABASE_HOST = "localhost"
DATABASE_NAME = "rakontu_or_whatever_you_want_to_call_it"
DATABASE_USER = "approcket_or_whatever_you_want_to_call_it"
DATABASE_PASSWORD = "whatever_you_set_the_approcket_password_to"
</pre>
</li>
<li>Set the <code>CURRENT_MODE</code> constant in <code>config.py</code>
to one of the modes listed in the file. (If you just want to backup, keep it as RECEIVE.)</li>
<li>Make sure you have Python 2.5 or greater installed on your system. (To find out, type "python -V" at a command prompt.)</li>
<li>Copy <code>rocket/station.py</code> from your GAE installation to a local machine.</li>
<li>Start your MySQL server. Create an empty database called <code>rakontu</code> (or whatever you named it
in your <code>config.py</code>). </li>
<li>Run <code>station.py</code> with the PythonLauncher or within IDLE (these come with the
Python distribution).</li>
</ol>

<p>To restore using AppRocket: Presumably you already did all the stuff in the backup section. Just edit <code>rocket/config.py</code> on 
your GAE installation and change the mode to one that sends, then run <code>station.py</code>.</p>

<p>Notes on using AppRocket:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two classes of object in the GAE datastore are <i>not</i> backed up to MySQL:
Helps and Exports. Helps come from the system and can't be changed per community, and are 
identical to what is in the "help.csv" file, so there is not much reason to back them up.
Exports are only kept as temporary generations for download and can easily be created again.
Also, some will be large enough to make MySQL choke. So these two classes are not downloaded.</li>

<li>The AppRocket backup includes <i>inactivated</i> Rakontus, members, questions, and characters. 
(Because so many things point to these objects, they are never removed, only made invisible.
Entries, annotations, answers and links <i>are</i> removed, because otherwise the site could get bloated with "dead wood".)
If for some reason you don't want anyone to see inactivated items, 
be aware that they will be in the MySQL database. You can remove them by doing a query there
on the "active" field and removing those with FALSE values.</li>

</ul>
