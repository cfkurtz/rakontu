<h3>Installing Rakontu</h3>

xxx

<h3>Customizing your installation</h3>

<p>There are a few steps that you MUST do when starting up a Rakontu site. After the software is installed,</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the SITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL address in site_configuration.py. This MUST be the email address associated 
with the Google account of one of the administrators of the application. If it isn't, people in Rakontus
on your site won't be able to send each other emails. If you don't want to list your personal email
here, create a Google account with a separate email you use only for this purpose.</li>
</ol>
