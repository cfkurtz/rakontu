<h2><a name="installing">Installing Your Rakontu Site</a></h2>

<p>Rakontu runs on the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>, a web framework. You should
read at least a few of the introductory articles on the GAE so you know a bit about what Rakontu is doing.
In particular, the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/">Getting Started Guide for Python</a>
is useful. (To those who know what this means: Rakontu uses Python and webapp, not Java and not pure django on GAE.)</p> 

<h3>Installation Step One: Download stuff</h3>

<ol type="a">
<li>Create a <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google</a> account.</li>
<li>If you don't already have <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python 2.5</a> installed, 
download and install it. (To find out, go to a command line and type <code>python -V</code>.) </li>
<li>Download and install the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html">Google App Engine SDK</a>.
</li>
<li>Go to the
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/rakontu/">Rakontu Google Code site</a>
	and check out the Rakontu source code from the Subversion repository there.
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> 
	with the <a href="http://www.easyeclipse.org/site/plugins/subclipse.html">Subclipse</a> plug-in works well for this.
	</li>
</ol>
	
<h3>Installation Step Two: Identify yourself</h3>

<ol type="a">
<li>Follow the instructions on the 
	<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/uploading.html">Uploading Your Application</a>
	page to create and register your new GAE application. During this process you will choose a unique
	GAE application identifier (they call it an "app_id").
	</li>
<li>In the Rakontu files you have downloaded, find the file called <code>app.yaml</code> (at the top level).
	At the top of app.yaml:
	<ul>
	<li><code>application: app_id &lt;-------- set this to your Google App Engine application id</code></li>
	<li><code>version: (something) &lt;------- you can change this if you like, it separates uploaded versions</code></li>
	</ul>
	Don't touch the rest of the app.yaml file.
	</li>
<li>In the <code>config</code> directory, find the file <code>site_configuration.py</code>.
	In that file, find this line:
	<ul><li><code>SITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL = "somebody@something.com"</code> </li></ul>
	Change the quoted part to the Google-account-related email you are using as the site administrator.
	This MUST be the email address associated 
	with one of the administrators of the application (according to GAE). If it isn't, you won't be
	able to get error emails from the Rakontu. If you don't want to list your personal email
	here, create a Google account with a separate email you use only for this purpose.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Installation Step Three: Upload your app</h3>

<ol type="a">
<li>Upload your slightly-modified Rakontu code to your GAE app, using the instructions on the 
	<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/uploading.html">Uploading Your Application</a> page
	at Google App Engine.
	</li>
<li>Look at your GAE <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/theadminconsole.html">Administrator Console</a>. 
	The "Versions" link there will show you the URL of your running app; it should be 
	http://your_app_id.appspot.com. If your app is running correctly, you should see the Rakontu
	start page there. If you don't see it, click on Logs in the Admin console to see if there are any
	error messages there. If you still can't get it to work, ask for help on the 
	<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rakontu-admins">Rakontu admins</a> Google group.</li>
</ol>
		
<h3>Installation Step Four: Initialize the site</h3>

<ol type="a">
<li>Once your Rakontu site is running, go to the start page and click on "Site administration".
	Follow the instructions there to complete the site initialization tasks. 
	These populate the site database with some objects that are used by all Rakontus.
	<i><b>These tasks must be done before any Rakontus are created.</i></b>
	</li>
	</ol>
	
<h3>Installation Step Five: Create a Rakontu</h3>

<ol type="a">
	<li>From your Rakontu admin screen, click "Create a Rakontu". Follow the instructions there
	to create a Rakontu.
	</li>
	<li>Before you start, you need to know what short-name you want to use
	for the Rakontu. It will appear on all URLs associated with the Rakontu and can NEVER
	be changed (unless you transfer the data to a new Rakontu).</li>
	<li>You also need to know the email address of the person who wants to own the Rakontu
		(it can be yourself). This MUST be one associated with a Google account the person will use.
		If you aren't the owner and you don't know the owner's email
		address, you can add the owner later by becoming an owner of the group yourself,
		then assigning them as another owner, then leaving the group.</li>
	</ol>
	
<p>If you want your app to be accessible from an easy-to-remember domain (like www.mysite.org) instead of your
		GAE appspot domain (myapp.appspot.com), follow the instructions on your admin console "Versions" page (under "Domain setup")
		to add a Google Apps account and make the connections there. It's not that hard. :)</p>

	
<h2><a name="watching">Watching over the site</a></h3>

<p>You can use your Site administration screen (http://your_app_id.appspot.com/admin/admin) to look over
the Rakontus on your site. You can enter or leave any Rakontu when you need to, to fix something
or help someone, as a member or manager. </p>

<p>If you are doing something time-intensive such as backing up or restoring, you should set the access
level for all affected Rakontus so that only you can see them. Everyone else will get a temporarily-unavailable message.
The Rakontus table in the administration screen will show a reminder of who can access the Rakontu by the
color of the drop-down box. (Green = everyone, yellow = managers only, orange = owners only, red = admin only.)
Be careful not to leave Rakontus unavailable for too long!
</p>
<p>You can set an optional message about why you are making the Rakontus unavailable in the administration screen.
This will appear in the temporarily-unavailable screen people will see when they visit any page of the Rakontu.</p>

<h2><a name="backup">Backing up, Restoring and Transferring Your Rakontu Site</a></h2>

<h3>Backup</h3>

<p>Even though Google backs up your data, it is a good idea to back up your data yourself as well.
The way to do this is to use the <code>backup.py</code> script in the <code>utilities</code>
directory in your Rakontu installation. Here's how to run it.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, find the file <code>backup_config.py</code> in the same directory where <code>backup.py</code> is found.</li>
<li>Open <code>backup_config.py</code> in a code editor or plain-text editor.
Change the settings there to match your installation.</li>
<li>Open a terminal window.</li>
<li>Change the directory (cd) to the directory where the <code>backup.py</code> script is found.</li>
<li>Type <code>python backup.py</code>.</li>
<li>The script should put XML files in directories for each Rakontu on your site.
These XML files are NOT encrypted, so make sure that ALL of the people in the Rakontus on your site know
that you (as the admin) can see ALL of their data, though it is in an ugly format.</li>
<li>The backup script retries all database connections three times, but if there are 
very long delays in the network or whatever, you may have to try backing up more than once.
If the script ends, there will be a "*.partial" file where the "*.xml" file should be.
Any partial files are not useful for restoration purposes and should be removed.
</li>
<li>Because you can run the backup script with a simple command line, you
should be able to set up a cron job to run it every so many days or so.
Choosing a time when few people are likely to be using the site makes sense.</li>
<li> 
<li>The backup script restricts access to the Rakontu while you are backing it up
to site administrators only (and puts it back to its former level afterward).
If there are multiple admins on the site, make sure they are not messing with the Rakontu
while you are backing it up.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Restoration</h3>

<p>If for some reason your Rakontu site gets ruined, you can restore it from backed-up XML files.
(You backed it up, right?) To do this, use the <code>restore.py</code> script in the <code>utilities</code>
directory in your Rakontu installation.</p>

<p>The <code>restore.py</code> script does only a <i>conservative</i> restore, meaning that it will NEVER
overwrite any object with the same key name identifier, and it will NEVER delete any object. 
This means that if the Rakontu you want to restore is on the site (but say riddled with spam or something), 
you MUST remove it before you can restore a saved copy of it.</p>

<p>To restore a Rakontu, follow these steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, find the file <code>restore_config.py</code> in the same directory where <code>restore.py</code> is found.</li>
<li>Open <code>restore_config.py</code> in a code editor or plain-text editor.
Change the settings there to match your installation.</li>
<li>Open a terminal window.</li>
<li>Change the directory (cd) to the directory where the <code>restore.py</code> script is found.</li>
<li>Type <code>python restore.py</code> followed by the name of the file you want to restore from. 
The file HAS to be in a directory under the one specified as <code>RESTORE_DIR</code>
in <code>restore_config.py</code>. 
</li>
<li>The restore script retries all database connections three times, but if there are 
very long delays in the network or whatever, you may have to try restoring more than once.
Because of the conservative restore, this should not be a problem: the restore script
can simply start adding things again, if they are not already there.</li>
<li>The restore script, unlike the backup one, does NOT restrict access to the Rakontu
while restoration is going on. (This is because the Rakontu may or may not exist.)
If you are restoring part of an existing Rakontu, you should set the access level
to "administrators only" yourself before beginning the restoration. If you don't,
the restoration script could collide with someone using the Rakontu.</li>
</ul>

<p>To restore only part of a Rakontu, follow the same steps as for the whole Rakontu.
Any objects that are already in the database (with the same IDs) will not be overwritten,
and only the deleted objects will be restored.</p>

<h3>Transfer</h3>

<p>To transfer a Rakontu to another site, follow the same instructions as for restoring it to
its own site, but use a different <code>APP_ID</code> in the <code>restore_config.py</code> file.</p>

<p>You can also <b>rename</b> a Rakontu as you restore or transfer it; just give the new name to the 
<code>restore.py</code> script as a second argument, after the file name to restore from.
For the right format, type <code>python restore.py help</code>.</p>

<h2><a name="configuring">Configuring your Rakontu site</a></h2>

<h3>Important files</h3>

<p>Once you've got the Rakontu source code, take a look at the directories and files. The structure is like this. File names
in <b>bold</b> should only be changed by people who know Python/django/Google App Engine.</p>

<ul>
<li>directory: <code>Rakontu</b></code>
	<ul>
	<li>directory: <code>config</code>. 
		<ul>
		<li>directory: </code> <code>english</code>. (Or another language directory if you want to use/create that.)
			<ul>
			<li>file: <code>default_characters.csv</code>. Determines what characters are created 
				when a new Rakontu is created. 
				</li>
			<li>file: <code>default_questions.csv</code>. Determines what questions appear in a new Rakontu.</li>
			<li>file: <code>sample_questions.csv</code>. Appear on question-management screens where people can copy them to use.
				</li>
			<li>file: <code>default_resources.txt</code>. Sets up the help resources that appear when a user
				clicks on "Help".
				</li>
			<li>file: <code>help.csv</code>. Controls the little icons with tooltip messages that 
				explain things all through the Rakontu site.</li>
			<li>file: <code>skins.csv</code>. Determines what skins (font and color themes)
				are available to Rakontus on the site. You can change these and add new skins for your site.</li>
			<li>file: <code>language_config.py</code>. Where ALL of the texts that display on the site
				are found. The source code and templates all refer to 
				constants found here. You can translate this file, or you can just change
				any of the texts here if they suit your site better. (E.g., you might add more explanation
				in some places where you find people get confused.)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>directory: <code>images</code>. Image files referred to by the <code>default_characters.csv</code> file.</li>
		<li>file: <code>site_configuration.py</code>. Contains constants that determine the
			behavior of your Rakontu site.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>directory: <code>utilities</code>. This contains the backup and restore utilities
		as well as a utility for checking your template files.</li>
	<li>files: <code><b>*.py</b></code>. Python source code. Ignore if you don't want to change the program.</li>
	<li>directory: <code><b>images</b></code>. These are the main image files used by Rakontu to show all of its
		error messages and icons.</li>
	<li>directory: <code><b>javascript</b></code>. At the moment this contains only one file which is used to make
		the top menus work in old versions of IE.</li>
	<li>directory: <code><b>pytz</b></code>. The python time zone library, with zipped time zone information.</li>
	<li>directory: <code><b>stylesheets</b></code>. Only one, base.css. Determines how Rakontu looks.</li>
	<li>directory: <code><b>templates</b></code>. LOTS of files here, essentially one per Rakontu screen.
		Much of the code logic is in these files, which use the django templating system.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>	

<h3>Changing particular configuration files</h3>

<p>Here is information about changing each file in the config directory.</p>

<h4>Characters: default_characters.csv</h4>

<p>Characters (one per line) are defined simply in this file. It determines what
characters are created in new Rakontus.</p>

<p>The columns in the characters file format are as follows, with one character per line.</p>
	<ol>
	<li><code>name</code> - Shows on all references to the character. Should be short.</li>
	<li><code>description</code> - Interpreted as plain text. May be of any length.</li>
	<li><code>etiquette statement</code> - Interpreted as plain text. May be of any length.</li>
	<li><code>picture file name</code> - Put the image in the config/images directory.</li>
	</ol>
	
<p>Notes on editing the default characters file:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don't want any characters to be created by default, simply remove or rename this file.</li>
<li>The default characters file influences Rakontus as they are being created. Changing this file
after a Rakontu is created will have no effect on it (but you can edit the character information in the Rakontu directly). 
Because the information is read directly from the file
(and not saved in the database), you don't to run an initialization task to load any changes.
</li>
<li>A semicolon at the very start of the first cell in the row will mean that the row contains
comments and should be ignored. Similarly, blank lines are ignored.</li>
<li>Don't put double quotes in cells. Use single quotes instead.</li>
<li>ALways save the file as Unicode-encoded text.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Questions: default_questions.csv, sample_questions.csv</h4>

<p>These two files determine the questions that display for any Rakontu on the site. The
<code>default</code> questions file determines what questions appear in every new Rakontu.
The <code>sample</code> questions file does the same but only for what appears in the "Sample questions"
section while Rakontu managers are changing questions.</p>

<p>The columns in the questions file format are as follows, with one question per line.</p>
	<ol>
	<li><code>refers to</code> - One OR MORE of member, character, story, pattern, collage, topic, resource. 
		Separate with pipes (|) if specifying more than one.</li>
	<li><code>use for</code> - This connects to the Rakontu types in <code>site_configuration.py</code> and determines
		which Rakontus get which questions. If a question should be used in more than one, separate them
		with pipes. If the question should be used in ALL Rakontu types, leave this column blank.</li>
	<li><code>name</code> - The short name displayed in filters and when "show details" is off.</li>
	<li><code>text</code> - The question itself (should end with a ?). This is displayed when the person is
		actually answering the questions. It is also shown when looking at answers when "show details" is on. 
		Only the first 500 characters of the text will be used, and line endings will be removed.
		Also note that if you put a double quote here, the Python CSV reader will cut
		off the remainder of the text. It is SUPPOSED to handle two double quotes ("") as one,
		but for some reason it doesn't. Just use single quotes as double quotes here.
		</li>
	<li><code>type</code> - Must be ONE of ordinal, nominal, text, boolean, or value (EXACTLY).</li>
	<li><code>choices</code> - The meaning of this column depends on the question type, thus:
		<ul>
		<li>If the type is ordinal or nominal, this is a pipe (|) delimited list of choices (e.g., happy, sad, calm).</li>
		<li>If the type is value, this is the minimum - dash - maximum (e.g., 1-20)</li>
		<li>if the type is boolean this is the "yes" text, a pipe (|), and then the "no" text (e.g, Okay why not|No way!) (these can have commas)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><code>multiple</code> - whether, if the type is ordinal or nominal, the user can check more than one</li>
	<li><code>help</code> - this appears in italics just after the question proper and is used to give more explanation of it</li>
	<li><code>use help</code> - this is to communicate with other managers about the situations in which a question is useful. It appears
		in the screen where one is managing the question. Regular members do not see it. You may want to use
		this area if you are sharing questions with other managers.</li>
	</ol>
	
<p>Notes on editing the questions files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading the same questions multiple times will create multiple questions with the
same name, so be careful not to have duplicates in these files.</li>
<li>The file format for default and sample questions is <i>identical</i> to that
for questions read from a CSV file (presumably traded by Rakontu managers).</li>
</ul>
	
<h4>Resources: default_resources.txt</h4>

<p>This file specifies the new resources that form by default when a new Rakontu is created.
You can change these to suit your installation, especially if you find yourself explaining
the same things over and over. </p>

<p>This is a plain-text file (save in Unicode .TXT format) that uses the old 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI-style syntax</a>. The name of each
resource begins each section, in [Square brackets]. After the name comes several lines (copy 
these to make new default resources) that determine the options for that resource. For each
of the option lines, don't change what is on the left of the equals sign, but DO change
what is on the right.
After the equals-sign lines comes the resource proper. All lines up to the next
square bracket (that begins a line) are considered to be in the resource.</p>

<p>Notes on editing the resources file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because resources are copied into each Rakontu on creation,
editing this file will have NO impact on existing Rakontus.
For those you will need to edit the resources directly, using the Rakontu interface.</li>
<li>Lines that start with a semicolon are considered comments and ignored.</li>
<li>The categories are sorted when displayed in alphabetical order. You can 
control the order they show in by putting numbers in front of them.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Help texts: help.csv</h4>

<p>The help text file determines the little pop-up tooltips that appear over icons all over the site
for context-sensitive help. If you find yourself answering a lot of questions about particular
issues or areas, you may want to improve these.</p>

<p>The columns in the help file format are as follows, with one tooltip per line.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>type</code> - This MUST be one of info, tip, caution, or button. This determines
what little icon appears when it is called for (in the site templates).</li>
<li><code>lookup name</code> - This MUST match a corresponding name in the template files.
Unless you are changing the templates, do NOT change these.</li>
<li><code>translated name</code> - You can translate or change this to affect
what appears in the URL and page when a user clicks on the little icon
(in case they can't read the tooltip for some reason). </li>
<li><code>text</code> - What appears in the tooltip, or on the page if they click the icon.
Only the first 500 characters will be used; line breaks will be removed.
Also note that if you put a double quote here, the Python CSV reader will cut
off the remainder of the text. It is SUPPOSED to handle two double quotes ("") as one,
but for some reason it doesn't. Just use single quotes as double quotes here.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes on editing the help file:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can make changes to <code>help.csv</code> and recreate the help texts anytime,
and all Rakontus on the site will be affected. The help texts are not copied into Rakontus
(like the default questions or resources) but are centrally looked up, so you can
change them for existing Rakontus.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Skins: skins.csv</h4>

<p>The skins file determines what colors and fonts make up the available skins.</p>

<p>The columns in the skins file format are as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>ELEMENT</code> - These link up with variables in the source code, so don't change these names.</li>
<li><code>EXPLANATION OF ELEMENT</code> - These describe where the colors/fonts are used and are for your information.</li>
<li>The rest of the columns in the file are skin definitions, one per column.
The <code>name</code> of each skin is at the top of the column. It can contain spaces.
</li>
<li>
For font names, write them just as you would for use in a style sheet;
put quotes around names with spaces in them, and always include a generic
font type at the end, like "sans-serif".
</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes on editing the skins file:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can
change this file after Rakontus are created. Rakontus save only the NAME of their skin,
so if the definition of the skin with that name changes afterward, they will automatically
update with the new colors. (Which you may or may not want to happen.)</li>
<li>For colors, paste them in hex format from a hex color generator or web site
(<a href="http://www.december.com/html/spec/color.html">this one</a> is good).
For colors that are ONLY numbers (have no alphabetic content) you will need to
put them in quotes. Otherwise the CSV reader thinks they are numbers
and gets confused. Follow the convention in the file.</li>
<li>The names of skins don't have to be in English; in fact that is the only 
reason the <code>skins.csv</code> file is in the language directory,
because you might want to translate the names. (But remember, changing
the name of a skin will make it no longer match the skin name in any
existing Rakontus. If they choose a new skin they can fix this.)</li>
<li>Skin names MUST be unique; you can't have two skins with the same name.</li>
<li>One of the skin names MUST match the value in the <code>language_config.py</code>
file, on this line:
	<ul><li><code>DEFAULT_SKIN_NAME = "sunset"</code></li></ul>
So, if you rename that skin, make sure to change the corresponding constant.
</li>
<li>When Rakontus use a "custom" skin, the system copies the skin information
from one of the skins in the <code>skins.csv</code> file. This is determined by
a constant in <code>language_config.py</code>, thus:
	<ul><li><code>START_CUSTOM_SKIN_NAME = "grayscale"</code></li></ul>
If you want to change what skin the custom-skin parameters start with,
you can change the value there.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Language-specific texts: language_config.py</h4>

<p>In this file are all of the display texts and options that could possibly vary by language.
Here also are many terms referred to by the template files. Essentially, every word a user
can see on a Rakontu site is in this file, unless it has come from the other files
in the language directory.</p>

<p>If you are not translating Rakontu, you should not have to edit this file. Still,
you may find yourself wanting to edit this file for your site just to head off frequently-asked
questions (by putting the answer right on the page).</p>

<p>There are copious notes in this file which you should read before/as you change things.</p>

<h4>Site parameters: site_configuration.py</h4>

<p>In this file are all the parameters that can be safely changed without messing up the source code.
These are things you might want to change from the defaults to make your site work in a slightly
different way. As with language_config.py, read the copious notes as you change things.</p>

<h2><a name="translating">Translating Rakontu</a></h2>

<p>You can translate a Rakontu site to any language you like. The copy you have downloaded may already include
multiple translations, so check the <code>config</code> directory to see what language subdirectories are available.</p>

<p>To create a new Rakontu translation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a language name that is short and descriptive, like
"francais" or "espanol." <i>Don't include any spaces or special characters in your language name.</i></li>
<li>Create a new directory under the <code>config</code> directory with your language name.</li>
<li>Make copies of all of the files in the <code>config/english</code> directory
and put them in your new language directory. </li>
<li>Edit each of these files so that they work for your language. 
Follow the instructions in each file and section. 
If you are unsure where a particular piece of text is used, look for its identifier in the
<code>templates</code> directory. That will show you the context of use.
<i>But don't mess with the template files!</i></li>
Always <i>make lots of backups</i> of all files you are changing!</li>
<li>Open the file <code>config/site_configuration.py</code>.
Change the line that reads <code>SITE_LANGUAGE = "english"</code> to your language name.
</li>
<li>Test your Rakontu site with the new translations in place.
It's a good idea to test the site locally (with <code>localhost</code>) before you upload
the code, because you can see changes faster. (Note, for some irritating reason,
you have to keep resaving <code>utils.py</code> every time you change anything in <code>language_config.py</code>
before the change will show up on the screen.)</li>

<p>Notes on translation:</p>
<ul>
<li>There can only be one language working on a Rakontu installation
at any one time,
but you can <i>store</i> more than one set of language files on a site and change which are being used by switching one
constant. In this way you can <i>develop</i> a set of language files and implement them on several sites
in nearly the same way (except for that one constant). Thus for example if you want to offer multiple
languages to people whose Rakontus you are supporting, just set up multiple installations and
direct people to whichever language installation they want to use.</li>
<li><i>Only the things the user sees
are translated</i>. All <i>internal</i> references are in English. This means that question export and import 
does not use translations, nor does backup and restore.
However, exports of entries to CSV (with answers) DOES use translations, because it is not a "round trip" function.</li>
</ul>
