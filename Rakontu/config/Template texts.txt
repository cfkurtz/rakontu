What's a Rakontu?
It's a place where people share and use stories together.
You could see it as a living-history museum of stories, as well as
a gathering place where people build their story museum together
and draw from it to remember the past, understand the present
and find solutions for the future.
(If you're wondering: Rakontu is Esperanto for "tell a story.")
What's Rakontu?
Rakontu is an open source software package that helps groups of people share and work
with stories. The Rakontu project is being carried out (at this point) mainly
by Cynthia Kurtz.
This alpha stage prototype is currently being tested.
If you want to help with testing, join the
Rakontu discussion group
and ask for the password to try out the site.</p.
You can find out more at rakontu.org.

../templates/manage/first.html
=====================

Welcome to your new Rakontu, [ref]!
To get you started, here is a thirty-second explanation of important terms.
The most important thing in a Rakontu is, of course, its stories.
But there are four other types of entry as well: invitations to tell stories,
story collages, patterns people have observed in the stories, and resources that help
people remember and understand.
All of these things can be commented on, given descriptive tags, rated, asked questions about, and searched.
Many of the people in your Rakontu will participate as regular members.
However, there are three "helper" roles people can volunteer to take on to help the Rakontu become more useful to everyone.
Curators watch over the stories. They locate and fix problems in your story "museum."
Guides watch over the people. They help new members get started and answer questions.
Liaisons bridge worlds. They help people who don't use computers to participate in the Rakontu by entering
their stories and reading them stories others have told.
Of course there are also managers, who make the decisions. You, as the group's first owner, are also its first manager.
Note that even someone as important as you has to "become" a curator, guide or liaison to access those special pages.
Visit your preferences page to do that.
Those are the basics! The best way to get started with your new site is to simply go down the items in the "Manage" menu (at the top of the page)
clicking on each one, and look at all the options you see there. Then start
asking some people to join you,
asking them to tell stories, and telling some stories yourself!
One more thing: around the site you will see little icons that provide help. Either hover over them with your mouse or click on them
to read a bit of help about the area in which they appear.
If you do not see any icons below, your site administrator has not yet generated the help system.
