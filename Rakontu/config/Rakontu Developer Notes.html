<h1>Rakontu Developer Notes</h1>

<p>Last revised by Cynthia Kurtz, October 2009.</p>

<p>These notes are to help any developer of Rakontu get started. They are also for me myself,
for later on. 
To write this, I've just sat here and noted here everything I think I <i>might</i> forget (which is a lot)
and which I think may be important to remember later.</P.

<h3>Where stuff is</h3>

xxxxx

<h3>Things Rakontu needs done</h3>

testing
code review
better graphics
more documentation - tutorials, etc

<h3>Things that surprised me (and may surprise you, if you don't read this)</h3>

- the django ifequal bug



<h3>Things NOT to do</h3>

- don't add any raw text to the templates
- 

<h3>Things I am not happy about</h3>

transactions should be using keys_only queries

always use match fetch number (1000) even when that is not likely (slows it down?)

needs better error handling. no try excepts around puts or transactions. have global exception handler
