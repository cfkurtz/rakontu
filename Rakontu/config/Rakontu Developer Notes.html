<h1>Rakontu Developer Notes</h1>

<p>Last revised by Cynthia Kurtz, October 2009.</p>

<p>These notes are to help any developer of Rakontu get started. They are also for me myself,
for later on. 
To write this, I've just sat here and noted here everything I think I <i>might</i> forget (which is a lot)
and which I think may be important to remember later.</P.

<h3>Where stuff is</h3>

xxxxx

<h3>Things Rakontu needs done</h3>

testing
code review
better graphics
more documentation - tutorials, etc

<h3>Things that surprised me (and may surprise you, if you don't read this)</h3>

- the django ifequal bug



<h3>Things NOT to do</h3>

- don't add any raw text to the templates
- 

<h3>Things I am not happy about</h3>

transactions should be using keys_only queries

always use match fetch number (1000) even when that is not likely (slows it down?)

needs better error handling. no try excepts around puts or transactions. have global exception handler

unit testing, testing suites

<h4>Template (html) files</h4>

<p>You can change the files in the "templates" directory to customize how your Rakontu looks and works.
However, follow a few guidelines:
<ul>
<li>There is <b>no raw text allowed</b> in the template files.
This allows a person to translate ONLY the constants in language_config.py, and not mess with the
template files, to translate Rakontu. If you make changes to template files and contribute them
to Rakontu, PLEASE keep raw texts out of them. A way to check that you have no raw text there
is to run the <code>showTranslationStringsInTemplates.py</code> script. It will generate a file called 
"Template texts.txt" which shows you where all the raw strings (texts) are in the templates.
