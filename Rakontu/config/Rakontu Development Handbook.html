<h3>Translating Rakontu</h3>

<p>You can translate a Rakontu site to any language you like. The copy you have downloaded may already include
multiple translations, so check the <code>config</code> directory to see what languages are available.</p>

<p>To create a new Rakontu translation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a language name that you will use across all files. It should be short and descriptive, like
"francais" or "espanol." <i>Don't include any spaces or special characters in your language name.</i></li>
<li>Make copies of all of the files in the <code>config</code> directory that start with <code>english_</code>.
Substitute your language name for <code>english</code> in the copies. </li>
<li>Edit each of these <code>yourlanguage_</code> files so that they work for your language. 
Follow the instructions in each file and section. Always <i>make lots of backups</i> of all files you are changing!</li>
<li>Open the file <code>config/site_configuration.py</code>.
Change the line that reads <code>SITE_LANGUAGE = "english"</code> to your language name.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes on translation:</p>
<ul>
<li>There can only be one language working on a Rakontu installation
at any one time,
but you can <i>store</i> more than one set of language files on a site and change which are being used by switching one
constant. In this way you can <i>develop</i> a set of language files and implement them on several sites
in nearly the same way (except for that one constant). Thus for example if you want to offer multiple
languages to people whose Rakontus you are supporting, just set up multiple installations and
direct people to whichever language installation they want to use.</li>
<li>An important thing to understand about translating Rakontu is that <i>only the things the user sees
are translated</i>. All <i>internal</i> references are in English. This means that question export and import 
does not use translations, nor does backup and restore to MySQL.
However, exports of entries to CSV (with answers) DOES use translations, as does XML export, because these are not "round trip"
(import <i>and</i> export) functions.</li>
