Rakontu is a web application that communities, organizations, groups and families can use to share and work with raw stories of personal experience for mutual understanding, conflict resolution and decision support. Rakontu is free and open source. It runs on the free Google App Engine.

Hi everybody. I'm [Cynthia Kurtz](http://www.cfkurtz.com), the author of Rakontu. I'm a consultant and researcher in the field of organizational and community narrative. Rakontu is half of my effort to bring the ideas and methods I developed and use with big government and corporate clients to the aid of every small group with a goal. The other half of the effort is my free on-line book [Working with Stories](http://www.workingwithstories.org).

As of mid 2010 I'm no longer actively working on or supporting Rakontu. (Rakontu has been a labor of love, and at the moment I'm all out of love ;) However, the source code is  available and anyone is free to install and use it. If you do use it, please let me know (send an email to cfkurtz at cfkurtz dot com). If you want to help make Rakontu better, let me know that too. I can't spend much time on it at the moment, but I do want to see it grow as a common resource.

For more information about what Rakontu is about and why I built it, see [rakontu.org](http://www.rakontu.org).
